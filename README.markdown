This repository try to describe a few code katas focused on web applications.

Those katas will hopefully allow you to try new web frameworks and/or languages.

## Contributions

Of course any contributions are welcome: new katas, updates on existing ones, ideas, anything!

Right now the katas are more back-end oriented. It could be interesting to have inputs from
front-end developers, for instance some `README.frontend.markdown` with more directive of how
the application should look and behave.
